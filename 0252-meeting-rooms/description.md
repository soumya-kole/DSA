# [252. Meeting Rooms 🔒](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms)

## Description

You are given an array of meeting times `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`.

A person can attend all meetings if no two meeting intervals overlap. Meetings ending at time `t` and starting at time `t` **do not** overlap.

​​​​​​​Return `true` if a person can attend all meetings. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`
